In our game, we have an AI trying to find the banana before the player. The AI uses the A star graph traversal algorithm to find the shortest path between its position and the position of the banana. To make the game a little easier for the player. When the AI is searching for a path, we randomly choose cells to block so that the AI has to find another path. If the only path is blocked, the AI will move in a random direction to simulate thinking. When the AI has found a path, it will start walking in the direction that it has to go. If the player finds the item before the AI, the AI will find a path to the next item and start moving as soon as it finds the new path.
