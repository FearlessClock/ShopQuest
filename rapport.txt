In our game, we have an AI trying to find the banana before the player. The AI uses the A star graph traversal algorithm to find the shortest path between its position and the position of the banana. To make the game a little easier for the player. When the AI is searching for a path, we randomly choose cells to block so that the AI has to find another path. If the only path is blocked, the AI will move in a random direction to simulate thinking. When the AI has found a path, it will start walking in the direction that it has to go. If the player finds the item before the AI, the AI will find a path to the next item and start moving as soon as it finds the new path. 

The game is made around a gameloop with events. The game starts by generating the maze and reading the generated maze from the text file. The maze is then passed through a function that creates the graph. We also figure out which types of walls to place where. At this stage, the player and the AI are placed in 2 positions on the map, the window is initiated and the screen is drawn. The gameloop is launched at this moment. The gameloop allows us to continuesly update the game and try and keep it running at a stable framerate. During the gameloop, we check for user input and update the game accordingly by moving the player in the chosen direction and checking if he has found the item. We then proceed to updating the AI. If the AI already knows where to go, he just moves in the direction he has to go otherwise, he looks for a new path to the item. The loop finishes by updating the screen with the new data.
